		"I have been assigned a brand new {{{plane}}}! {{name.first}}, my good friend and my first mechanic, insists I should hop in and familiarize myself with this new machine - make a test flight over and around the airfield, push the engine to its limits and see how the airframe behaves in the air.",
		"One of the {{{plane}}}s has recently underwent a complete engine overhaul on the field. While {{name.first}}, our chief mechanic, assured commander {{{rank.commander}}} {{name.last}} that everything is in order - nevertheless, a test flight has been scheduled to determine if the machine is combat ready. I am to fly over the airfield and make note of the engine performance.",
		"The tail section of my trusty {{{plane}}} has sustained heavy damage from anti-aircraft fire during our recent trip over enemy territory. {{name.first}}, my mechanic, has now finished fixing and patching up the plane. While at it, he has also mentioned to have done some improvements to control surfaces and that I should test flight and make note of any changes."
