		"I have just returned from an extended leave and can't wait to get back in the cockpit! {{{rank.commander}}} {{name.last}}, our commander, insists I should keep calm and restrain myself from any combat action. I am to take {{{plane}}} for a practice flight over and around the airfield - familiarize myself with the controls and feel how the airframe behaves in the air.",
		"I don't feel too confident flying this {{{plane}}}. My flight leader {{{rank.leader}}} {{name.last}} has noted this already and mentioned that during our last combat mission I was struggling maintaining required flight formation. As frustrating as it may be - I have been ordered to fly a number of practice flights over and around the airfield.",
		"This {{{plane}}} is quite a different machine from what we used to fly in our training unit! While I am eager to get some real combat action - I don't feel confident enough in my handling of this new type of aircraft. As per my request, {{{rank.commander}}} {{name.last}}, our commander, has gave me direct permission to fly a series of practice flights over the airfield."
